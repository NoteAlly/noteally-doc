# Definition of Ready

The following are our proposal for the criteria that a user story must meet to be considered "ready" for development:

- **Small**: The user story should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint.
- **Independent**: The user story should not be dependent on any other user story or task.
- **Defined Acceptance Criteria**: The user story should have clearly defined acceptance criteria that can be used to determine when the story is complete.
- **Testable**: The user story should be testable, with a clear way to verify that it has been implemented correctly.
- **Prioritized**: The user story should be prioritized based on its importance to the project and its value to the user.
- **Estimated Cost**: The user story should have an estimated cost in terms of time and effort required to complete it.
- **Valuable**: The user story should provide value to the user or the project.
- **Understood by the team**: The user story should be clearly understood by the development team, with any questions or concerns addressed before development begins.

If a user story meets all of these criteria, it can be considered "ready" for development.
